The purpose of this research project is to analyze the adversarial multi-agent game outcomes of Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) games to identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities in a system, that can impact the system fault tolerance. By doing this, the aim is to create a model that can enhance the system reliability and safety. DFTs are an advanced technique in reliability engineering used to analyze the reliability of complex systems.
